# Super Mario Maps 

This is a Super Mario map made using a Google Maps API Tutorial to learn more about using and implementing map APIs into projects.

## Lessons Learned

This tutorial helped me understand:
- How to make my own map ID
- How to style a map
- How to add markers to a map
- How to customise a marker
- Basic geocaching principles

I am now confident implementing map functionality to apps using a variety of map APIs using what I've learnt from this tutorial.

I experimented with this tutorial in order to research whether Google Maps API would be the best map API to implement over other options such as Leaflet API.
While I thought the documentation was clear and easy to navigate, we decided to implement Leaflet in our end of course project (see: [here](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/environment_variables_frontend.git)) due to similar functionality and it being free to use. This was important to us as we wanted to avoid accidental charges during development.
